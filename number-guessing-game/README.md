# Nmmber Guessing Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game project! This Python program is designed to demonstrate a smart guessing strategy based on the principles of binary search and optimization of the number of attempts required to guess a randomly selected integer within a given range.

## Optimized Guessing
```scss
Minimum number of guessing = log2(Upper bound â€“ lower bound + 1)
```
