# Twenty Plus One Game

Welcome to the Twenty Plus One Game project! This Python program is an intriguing number game known as "Twenty Plus One" or "21." In this game, players take turns counting numbers from 1 to 21, with the player who calls "21" being eliminated. 

## Game Overview

- The game starts with a list of numbers from 1 to 21.
- The player and the computer take turns choosing numbers from the list.
- The player can choose to start first or second.
- If consecutive numbers are not given as input, the player is automatically disqualified.
- The player loses if they get the chance to call "21" and wins otherwise.

## Implementation Details

**This Python program simulates the Twenty Plus One Game using object-oriented programming. Below are some key features of the game implementation:**

- The player can choose to start first or second.
- The list of numbers is displayed before the player takes their turn for convenience.
- If the player fails to provide consecutive numbers as input, they are disqualified.
- The player loses if they get the opportunity to call "21," and they win if they can avoid it.
